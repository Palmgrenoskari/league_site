Building a League of Legends Analytics App. Current name is a placeholder, final name depends on domain prices ^^

In the process of trying to get a production API Key for drastically higher rates. Current rate limit of 100 requests every 2 minutes is a bottleneck for certain features (like aggregates from masses of match data).
Also it is against the rules to deploy a product without going through the registering process first.
