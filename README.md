Building a League of Legends Analytics App. Name is still unknown, really depends on domain prices ^^

Trying to get a Dev API key soon. Current rate limit of 100 requests every 2 minutes is a bottleneck for further development.

I'd like to implement skill orders, build orders and rank of each individual player in the expanded match history entry. But this already requires (10+10)*10 = 200 requests for a match history of 10 entries.

I might be able to do the leaderboards even with 100 requests. Will see!
